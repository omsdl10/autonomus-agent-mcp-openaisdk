# 🤖 Autonomous AI Agent using OpenAI SDK and MCP

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how to build an **autonomous AI agent** capable of performing reasoning, decision-making, and tool-based actions using the **OpenAI SDK** and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.  
The agent can connect to external tools or APIs (file systems, or REST APIs) via MCP servers, enabling it to take real-world actions safely and intelligently.

## 🧩 Key Features
- 🧠 **Autonomous Task Execution:** The agent can plan, reason, and execute tasks with minimal human input.  
- 🔗 **MCP Integration:** Connects the agent with external systems or APIs securely via the Model Context Protocol.  
- 🗂️ **Memory & Context Handling:** Maintains conversation context and learns from previous steps using OpenAI’s SDK tools.  
- ⚙️ **Tool Use:** Supports multiple tool integrations — data retrieval, summarization, API calling, and file management.  
- ☁️ **Modular Design:** Easily extendable architecture to plug in new tools, agents, or data connectors.
